# DBLP Search for Sublime

This plugin for SublimeText 2 is a small extension to working with  LaTeX
documents. It allows you to define a query to DBLP and will present  you with a
list of matching papers. Selecting a paper will insert the necessary DBLP
citation key.

This can be used in conjunction with [rDBLP][dblp] to automatically maintain
your bib files for your current publication.

The current keyboard shortcut is:

	CTRL+. , CTRL+d
